# Get your Odoo Base
Place your odoo base directory in this path, `place only one directory`.

You can clone Odoo Community to this directory.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/odoo/odoo -b $ODOO_VERSION --depth 1
```

> ⚠️ You can enter which version on you want to clone on `$ODOO_VERSION` variable. For example:
> - `16.0` ➡️ Will clone the version 16.0
> - `17.0` ➡️ Will clone the version 17.0
