# Odoo Docker Image
A Dockerfile to create a custom Odoo docker image.

| Specification | Version |
|----|----|
|Python|`'3.7'` (recommended) or `'3.10'`|
|Odoo version|`'16'`|
|PostgreSQL|`'14'`|

| Python `'3.10'` has slower build time and not compatible with ks_dashboard.

# Folder Structure
There are some points you should know:
- You should add your `odoo-base` to the directory.
- Add your custom addon to `git` directory.
- Add your custom addon in the `conf` file
- Make sure in `run-odoo.sh` to use your config file and run the odoo binary inside `odoo-base`
- for `datadir` and and `log` will be generated by image builder, because it uses NFS as the persistent storage. 
- Got to your container (`docker exec -itu root $YOUR_CONTAINER_HASH bash`), install `apt install -y ttf-mscorefonts-installer` to add microsoft fonts. (Don't miss to **Accept the EULA**)
  ```bash
  sudo add-apt-repository multiverse
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install -y ttf-mscorefonts-installer
  ```
